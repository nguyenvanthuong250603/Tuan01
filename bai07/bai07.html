        A smile is a facial expression formed primarily by flexing the muscles
        at the sides of the mouth. It is believed it takes about 80 muscles to
        smile. Some smiles include a contraction of the muscles at the corner of
        the eyes, an action known as a "Duchenne smile". Smiles performed
        without the eye contraction may be perceived as insincere.
